n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 5)

Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries.

weights : str or callable, optional (default = ¡®uniform¡¯)

weight function used in prediction. Possible values:

¡®uniform¡¯ : uniform weights. All points in each neighborhood are weighted equally.
¡®distance¡¯ : weight points by the inverse of their distance. in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
[callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape containing the weights.
algorithm : {¡®auto¡¯, ¡®ball_tree¡¯, ¡®kd_tree¡¯, ¡®brute¡¯}, optional

Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

¡®ball_tree¡¯ will use BallTree
¡®kd_tree¡¯ will use KDTree
¡®brute¡¯ will use a brute-force search.
¡®auto¡¯ will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm based on the values passed to fit method.
